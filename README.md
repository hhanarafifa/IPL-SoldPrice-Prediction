**Background**

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional league for Twenty20 (T20) cricket championships that was started in 2008 in India. The first IPL auction was held in 2008 for ownership of the teams for 10 years, with a base price of USD 50 million. The franchises acquire players through an English auction that is conducted every year. However, there are several rules imposed by the IPL. For example, only international players and popular Indian players are auctioned.
